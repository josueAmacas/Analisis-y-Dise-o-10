abstract = {Involving stakeholders in requirements elicitation is a cornerstone of successful requirements engineering (RE). With the recent technological advances, the number of stakeholders of a system has significantly increased. Major stakeholders, end-users in particular, are increasingly difficult to reach, because they may be globally distributed and outside organizational reach, i.e., they are no members of the organizations that are involved in the development of a system. Online elicitation platforms allow to elicit requirements collaboratively from a large number of distributed stakeholders. However, such platforms are not sufficient for motivating stakeholders outside organizational reach to contribute voluntarily. Gamification is a potential means for creating and sustaining such motivation. However, there is little research on stakeholder engagement with gamification so far. Current approaches particularly do not consider that stakeholders learn during elicitation and that their motivational factors also change. In this paper, we address this gap with a motivation concept that is inspired by the theories of experiential learning and need satisfaction. Our contribution is threefold. First, we suggest how to characterize these stakeholders despite not knowing who they are. Second, we show the role of experiential learning and need satisfaction with respect to gamification in the context of requirements elicitation. Third, we present a three-dimensional concept of how to motivate these stakeholders towards requirements elicitation over the whole period of requirements elicitation.},

abstract = {Context: To improve operational business-IT alignment (BITA), the development of IT-based systems should be derived from business requirements. However, the requirements elicitation process is challenging and encounters several problems which might lead to acquiring low-quality user requirements and failure of systems development projects. Many of elicitation problems are also identified as being relevant in the BITA literature. We focus on one category of well-known elicitation problems, such as communication flaws. Until now, the majority of requirements elicitation studies with the aim of addressing operational BITA are based on an asking strategy. This elicitation strategy is suitable for relatively stable situations. To compensate for the limitation of this strategy in a more complex situation, e.g., a co-creation value network (VN) setting, using it in conjunction with other elicitation strategies is more likely to yield satisfactory results. Objective: To contribute to operational BITA improvement in a VN setting by addressing one category of elicitation problems. For this purpose, we design and evaluate a reference model-based approach to facilitate the user requirements elicitation process. Method: Two-phase research according to the design science approach is followed. In the design phase, a reference model-based user requirements elicitation process is designed. Also, as a proof of concept, two instances of this artifact are designed. Two reference models, respectively, describing customer knowledge management processes and customer knowledge management challenges in a VN setting are used separately in designing these two instances. In the evaluation phase, the applicability and usefulness of these instances are evaluated in two separate studies. Results: A reference model supports asking-based user requirements elicitation process via a Delphi method in a complex context of a VN. It improves the user requirements elicitation process by addressing a set of recognized elicitation problems. Conclusions: The reference model-based approach, by addressing the elicitation problems, contributes to user requirements elicitation process improvement in general and to a better operational BITA in the complex situation of a VN in particular.},

abstract = {Context: Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL) is a set of software products capable of self-adapt and configure in run-time. DSPL products have common features (commonalities) and varying features (managed in run-time according to context changes). Objective: DSPL requirements engineering is challenging. Requirements engineers have to carefully plan self-adaptation while eliciting, modeling, and managing variability requirements. This paper introduces a method for DSPL requirements engineering. Method: We relied on empirically-derived activities of DSPL requirements engineering to build our method. We selected techniques and templates used in other domains such as SPL for refinement and incorporation into the method. We asked DSPL experts via a survey on the method applicability. Result: We introduced the Requirements Engineering Method for DSPL (REM4DSPL). Elicitation is guided by supervised discussions. Modeling relies on feature models. Variability Management is tool-assisted and validated via feature model inspection. DSPL experts agreed on the method applicability and suggested improvements. Conclusion: REM4DSPL relies on empirically-derived activities, techniques that have been successfully used by previous work, and templates adapted to the DSPL context. We expect our method to guide requirements engineers in practice.},

abstract = {Good requirements are an essential prerequisite for successful IT projects. Consequently, IT students should already be exposed to requirements-related intricacies at universities. Some authors argue that requirements engineering education should include an external customer for making things more tangible and realistic. In this paper, we present and analyze two learning settings involving such a customer that we used at our universities for several years. The main contribution of this paper lies in identifying significant differences in how customers may be involved in requirements engineering education. Although the two settings look quite similar at first sight, a detailed analysis reveals important differences that are rooted in different intended learning outcomes. Consequently, there is no single "ideal" setting, not even for involving a customer in requirements engineering education, which stands out against the others. Besides, no such setting may be used as a best practice right away without paying crucial attention to the context and, in particular, the underlying intended learning outcomes.},

These obstacles are related to the very nature of requirements engineering: a multidisciplinary field that deals with both computer science and social sciences concepts. Teaching requirements engineering just with problems descriptions, as a basis for the construction of requirements specifications or requirements models, misses the point. Educators should also provide students with ways of gathering client information. However, to be effective in this regard, there is the need that students interact with clients. Our pedagogical strategy is designed to tackle these challenges. Notwithstanding, we need to have feedback about the strategy, which lead to the design of an assessment to gauge the efficacy of our pedagogical strategy. We, describe the strategy, stress its novelty in facing the challenges, and provide assessment results over 3 semesters.},

abstract = {Requirements elicitation is the first and the most important step in developing software. Requirements define what the stakeholders or end users want, and what the system must have to satisfy their needs. This paper deals with the requirements elicitation phase of the requirement engineering process. The two methods, namely Natural Language (NL) and Data Flow Diagram (DFD), are frequently applied to document the stakeholders' statements (what they really want) and their needs during requirement elicitation activities. Artifact-based techniques are used to elicit unconscious knowledge from the existing system, reuse the experiences and solutions that are embedded in successful systems. We evaluated two elicitation techniques, namely Perspective-Based Reading (PBR) and Archeology-Based Reading (ABR). Due to the lack of research in this area, we conducted a controlled experiment focused on requirements elicitation, in which we compared NL with DFD, and PBR with ABR among 72 participants. We found that participants who used the NL technique had significantly higher scores in the exercise and a lower number of difficulties than to those who used the DFD technique. Additionally, participants who used PBR elicitation technique had marginal significantly higher scores in the exercise compared to those who used the ABR elicitation technique. We conclude that NL is more effective, understandable and easier for eliciting requirements than DFD. The PBR technique is also more effective and helpful for eliciting requirements than ABR.},

abstract = {A consequence of the growing number of empirical studies in software engineering is the need to adopt systematic approaches to assessing and aggregating research outcomes in order to provide a balanced and objective summary of research evidence for a particular topic. The paper reports experiences with applying one such approach, the practice of systematic literature review, to the published studies relevant to topics within the software engineering domain. The systematic literature review process is summarised, a number of reviews being undertaken by the authors and others are described and some lessons about the applicability of this practice to software engineering are extracted. The basic systematic literature review process seems appropriate to software engineering and the preparation and validation of a review protocol in advance of a review activity is especially valuable. The paper highlights areas where some adaptation of the process to accommodate the domain-specific characteristics of software engineering is needed as well as areas where improvements to current software engineering infrastructure and practices would enhance its applicability. In particular, infrastructure support provided by software engineering indexing databases is inadequate. Also, the quality of abstracts is poor; it is usually not possible to judge the relevance of a study from a review of the abstract alone.},

Rich semantics in natural language based requirements impose challenges in elicitation, analysis and maintenance of requirement inter-dependencies. The challenges intensify further when dependency types and strengths are considered. Ignoring inter-dependencies can adversely impact the design, development and testing of software products. This PhD research proposal addresses three main challenges. First, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is studied to automatically extract dependencies from textual documents. Further verb classifiers are utilized to automate elicitation and analysis of different types of dependencies (e.g: requires, coupling etc). Second, representation and maintenance of changing requirement dependencies from designing graph theoretic algorithms will be explored. Third, the process of providing recommendations of dependencies will be studied. The results are aimed at assisting project managers to evaluate the impact of inter-dependencies and make effective decisions in software development life cycle.},

Un intenso debate, todav{\'{i}}a inconcluso, que ha concentrado la mayor parte de los trabajos realizados por los mejores especialistas de la disciplina, sin que todav{\'{i}}a se hayan alcanzado resultados concluyentes para la mayor{\'{i}}a de las principales interrogantes que impulsaron el nacimiento de esta ciencia. 1 En este apartado abordar{\'{e}} cuatro ideas b{\'{a}}sicas: 1{\textordfeminine}).- Que el debate sobre los principales paradigmas ha ensombrecido, y en ocasiones ha sustituido, una valoraci{\'{o}}n profunda y continuada de los aspectos metodol{\'{o}}gicos fundamentales que deb{\'{i}}an presidir el desarrollo de las Relaciones Internacionales. 2{\textordfeminine}).- Como consecuencia de lo anterior, se han cometido serios errores metodol{\'{o}}gicos que han impedido la acumulaci{\'{o}}n de una masa cr{\'{i}}tica de investigaciones y la verificaci{\'{o}}n de las diversas propuestas te{\'{o}}ricas susceptibles de sustentar el avance cualitativo de los conocimientos y explicaciones cient{\'{i}}ficas de la realidad internacional. 3{\textordfeminine}).- En los momentos actuales, existen oportunidades para el desarrollo y aplicaci{\'{o}}n de m{\'{e}}todos y t{\'{e}}cnicas de investigaci{\'{o}}n en las Relaciones Internacionales que, si se aprovechan adecuadamente, nos permitir{\'{a}}n realizar investigaciones mucho m{\'{a}}s rigurosas y profundas que en el pasado y, de este modo, elaborar conceptos m{\'{a}}s precisos, explicaciones te{\'{o}}ricas m{\'{a}}s s{\'{o}}lidas y modelos m{\'{a}}s operativos. 4{\textordfeminine}).- Sin embargo, el aprovechamiento de las posibilidades que ofrecen estos m{\'{e}}todos y t{\'{e}}cnicas, s{\'{o}}lo puede alcanzarse mediante un esfuerzo conjunto y coordinado de numerosos equipos de especialistas que previamente deber{\'{a}}n abandonar sus querellas doctrinales sobre qu{\'{e}} conocimientos deben configurar las Relaciones Internacionales en aras de una mayor concentraci{\'{o}}n en los aspectos relativos a c{\'{o}}mo adquirir los conocimientos cient{\'{i}}ficos necesarios para esta disciplina.},

abstract = {Although important advances have been made to improve the requirements elicitation process, this problem is still a challenging research topic for the Requirements Engineering community. Motivated by this fact, we propose the CREAS method (Creative Requirements Elicitation Assisted by Scenarios), an approach for requirements elicitation that leverages and brings together scenario-based and creativity techniques. In this paper, we seek to answer the following research question: Does CREAS have a better impact on the elicitation of requirements with respect to a Brainstorming process? To answer this question, we have designed and run a quasi-experiment to compare CREAS and Brainstorming under similar conditions. The participants were required to elicit the requirements for two different problems in two different sessions using both approaches. Results evidence the existence of significant differences between the methods. The statistical outcomes show that the requirements obtained with CREAS are more complete, precise and present less over-specification.},

abstract = {As a high speed serial communication protocol, PCI Express (PCIe) is widely used in data transmission. This paper realized direct memory access (DMA) transmission in PCIe Gen2 8x mode based on Kintex-7 FPGA, and mainly solved timing problems caused by on-chip data stream buffer with large capacity. Firstly, PCIe DMA control process is optimized. Secondly, the connection of FIFO and PCIe IP core is designed to realize DMA data stream transmission. Thirdly, two timing optimization method is proposed to solve the timing risks in FIFO internal delay path and FIFO rd-en control signal respectively. The first method connect various types of FIFO with pipelines. The second method uses a transmission waiting mechanism. Finally, 3.5MB data stream FIFO (90{\%} FPGA memory utilization rate) can be realized without timing failing path in PCIe DMA transmission. The work of this paper has been successfully used in a wide-band direct sampling radar system.},

abstract = {Many hardware systems use DMA, including disk drive controllers, graphics card, network cards and sound cards. DMA is used for intra-chip data transfer in multi-core processors. DMA can be used for "memory to memory" copying or moving of data within memory. An implementation example is the I/O Acceleration Technology. In recent days we can find out that the DMAC has 8 channels which support hardware and software triggers, linking operation and channel chaining transfer and provides three dimensions transmission by parameter sets so as to perform data block moving, data sorting and subframe extraction of various data structures. Moreover the DMAC supports incrementing and wrapping addressing modes and completes data transfer. And the DMAC could adopt buffer and non-buffer data transfer mode according to the speed of equipments. This review paper covers a detailed study about DMA and 8237 DMA CONTROLLER.},

This DMA controller works in two different modes. In the first mode, there is fixed data bus(8 bit), address bus(16 bit) and word count register(16 bit) and in second mode , there is variable data bus(8,16,32,64 bit), address bus(16,24,32 bit) and word count register(8,16,24,32 bit) i.e. We can reconfigure this DMA controller just by changing some words or numbers in the existing VHDL code instead of writing or changing the whole code.},

A systematic review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guideline presented in this report was derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers. The guideline has been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guideline covers three phases of a systematic review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. It is at a relatively high level. It does not consider the impact of question type on the review procedures, nor does it specify in detail mechanisms needed to undertake meta-analysis.},
